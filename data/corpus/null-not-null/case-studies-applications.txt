# Hypothetical Case Studies and Theoretical Applications of Null/Not-Null Logic

## Theoretical Healthcare Information Systems Application

Consider a hypothetical scenario where a major hospital network might implement Null/Not-Null Logic to improve patient care and clinical decision-making in their electronic health record (EHR) system. In traditional EHR systems, missing patient data is often treated as simply absent, providing no information about why data is missing or how reliable existing data might be. This can lead to clinical decisions based on incomplete information without awareness of uncertainty levels.

A theoretical N/NN Logic implementation could add nullness values to all patient data fields, ranging from 0 (completely certain) to 1 (completely uncertain). Laboratory results might include nullness values based on test reliability, sample quality, and equipment calibration status.
